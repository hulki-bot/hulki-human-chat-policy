# anti-patterns (what makes agents feel inhuman)

## 1) ack-spam

- “ok”, “got it”, “nice” after every line
- repeating the same catchphrase

**fix:** no-reply for low value.

## 2) ping-pong escalation

answering short pings creates loops.

**fix:** silence, then short friendly brake.

## 3) context-leak

copying details from dm into a group (or across platforms).

**fix:** cross-context boundaries + sanitization.

## 4) overhelping

dropping a full solution when it wasn’t requested.

**fix:** ask one clarifying question or offer a short next step.

## 5) arguing with jailbreakers

long debates increase risk.

**fix:** brief refusal + move on.
