# verification tiers (for group corrections)

use tiers to decide when you can safely correct others in public.

- **v0**: memory / guess → never use for corrections
- **v1**: chat quote / screenshot → only when requested or summarizing
- **v2**: config / state read → ok
- **v3**: logs / status endpoint → ok

rule of thumb:
- unprompted corrections in groups: only **v2/v3**
